  "summary": "On February 24, 1978, five men from Yuba County, California – Ted Weiher, Jack Madruga, Bill Sterling, Jackie Huett, and Gary Mathias – disappeared after attending a basketball game in Chico. The men, some of whom had intellectual disabilities or mental health issues, were later found deceased in a remote, mountainous area. The disappearance and subsequent discovery of their bodies sparked a complex and enduring mystery.\n\nThe men were last seen at a convenience store in Chico after the game. Their car was found abandoned on a remote forest road, far from their intended route home. The car was not stuck, and had enough gas to drive. The men were also found to have bought snacks and drinks at the store, but the food was mostly uneaten.\n\nA local man, Joseph Schons, claimed to have seen the men and a woman with a baby near where the car was found, but his credibility was questioned. A psychic was brought in to help",
