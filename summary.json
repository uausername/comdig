  "summary": "On February 24, 1978, five men from Yuba County, California, disappeared after attending a basketball game in Chico. The men, Ted Weiher, Jack Madruga, Bill Sterling, Jackie Huett, and Gary Mathias, were all associated with Gateway Projects, a center for adults with developmental disabilities. The group traveled in Madruga's 1969 Mercury Montego, but they never made it home that night.\n\nThe disappearance sparked a massive search effort involving law enforcement, family, and community members. Four days later, Madruga's car was found abandoned on a remote mountain road in the Plumas National Forest, far off the route they would have taken home. The car was in good working order, but the men were nowhere to be found.\n\nThe discovery of the car led to an extensive search of the surrounding area. Weeks later, the body of Ted Weiher was discovered in a Forest Service trailer. He had died of starvation",
